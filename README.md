scst

This is my fork of the SCST (http://scst.sourceforge.net/) SVN repo 
with a Debian GNU/Linux directory so that I can easily build my own
packages without hassle.

The upstream svn tags I have commited here can be found using:

    git tag -l 'upstream/*'

My own tags I'm using with

   git tag -l 'r*'
